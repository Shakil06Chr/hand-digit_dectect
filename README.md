This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using 
a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and a 
Random Forest Classifier for classification. I have tried to train many traditional machine learning models such as KNN,Decissiontree,and SVN.
